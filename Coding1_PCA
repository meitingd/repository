# In this coding assignment, you are asked to write a function to conduct PCA for a data set, represented as a 2D array. You must follow all the instructions carefully.

"""
Instructions:
1. The libraries and modules you need are imported for you. Please do NOT use any other libraries or modules.
2. Please do NOT use svd function provided by linalg.
3. Use four spaces as your identation.
4. Please rename your function by replacing my net ID with yours, lowercase please.
5. The function name (net ID part) is the only thing you can change. Do Not change anything else in the starter code.
